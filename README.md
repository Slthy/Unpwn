# Unpwn
_As simple as secure_

**Unpwn** is a lightweight iOS Password manager that helps to keep your accounts safe from being pwned.  

## Versions
### Version 1.0 - Hello world

Unpwn is born!  
With a simple UI, Unpwn comes to help people to secure their accounts, creating passwords based on user's preferences.  
Every user can:

    1. Decide to use lowercase characters in their passwords
    2. Decide to use uppercase characters in their passwords
    3. Decide to use numbers in their passwords
    4. Decide to use special characters in their passwords
    5. The password's length, from 1 to 64 characters

At this part of the project, Unpwn's development is currently more functionality-based than on the graphic side, but hang on, the future major-updates will be oriented to the graphic side

### Version 2.0 - Slide and Check Update

Hello everyone!
In this update Unpwn gets rich of another feature: now you can check your own password if your password has been part of data breaches through _Have i been pwned?_'s database. But that's not all! Unpwn now has a new homepage that directs to every feature of the app.
